## Installation

Before you start, you need to globally install create-js-project via npm or yarn:

```powershell

npm i -g create-js-project

yarn global add create-js-project

```
Then, follow these 3 simple steps:

1. Create a project, optionally providing a [project-name] for your project:

```powershell

create-js-project [project-name]

npm init js-project [project-name]

```
2. Answer the questions, such as your project's name and desired template.

3. Wait until the installation is complete and start coding!
